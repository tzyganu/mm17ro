# Because it's in the core  
These are my slides from MeetMagento Romania 2017.  
In case the disclaimer slide does not make it clear, you can find below an explanation of my presentation.  
I make myself enough of a target at the conference. I don't people to get the wrong idea.  

# Explanation  
The presentation is named "Because it's in the core" because I've heard this phrase too many times as a response to the quetion "Why did you do it like this?".  
"Because it's in the core" should not be the MAIN reason for taking solving a Magento problem in a certain way.  
It can be used as a tipping point reason when the pros and cons are balanced, but not as the MAIN reason.  
So in order to explain why I think this, my presentation contains a few inconsitencies and logic flaws from the magento 1 and 2 core.  
The point of the presentation is not to bash the core team(s). I tried to wrap it up in an educational "coat".  
Most of the people got the idea, but there were a few others that didn't.  

Some of the slides may not make sense on their own, without the words I said around them.  
If something is unclear feel free to contact me. My contact details are in on of the slides.
